# NoteKeeper

## What is it

A simple app (or "app") to write notes and store them for later. Several notes may be saved (though there is a finite amount of memory; later versions may improve upon this), edited, read, re-edited, re-read, and eventually deleted.

## Where to use

It is designed to be used on a cellular device with a touch screen. Though if one insists, any device with a screen and a pointing device will do, in principle.

## NB!

Web API is used to store the entered texts. Meaning no personal information (such as passwords) should be stored here. Later versions may improve upon this as well.
